  description: `Without needing to make a test—and even without tools—you can quickly jury-rig or repair a mundane item or piece of equipment related to a skill you have from the crafting skill group. That item lasts for 1 hour or works for one use or activation (whichever comes first, as the Director determines), then breaks beyond repair. For example, if you have the Carpentry skill, you could repair a rickety wooden bridge long enough for a group of creatures to cross it, or build a simple shovel made of wood that can be used for 1 hour.`,
