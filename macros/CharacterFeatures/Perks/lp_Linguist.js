Additionally, if you spend 7 days or more in a place where you regularly hear or read a language you donâ€™t know, you can pick up enough of that language to hold a conversation or understand basic written information. Having picked up a language this way, you can subsequently learn it using the Learn New Language research project at half the usual project goal cost.`,
