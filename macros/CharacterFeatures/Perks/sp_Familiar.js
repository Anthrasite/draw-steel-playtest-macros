  description: `A supernatural spirit who has taken the form of a specific small animal or animated object has chosen to be your familiar—or to adopt you as their familiar.</p>
    <p>The spirit uses the familiar stat block.</p>
    <p>The familiar can hold small objects in their mouth or claws, but can’t perform activities that would typically require hands (opening a door, unrolling a scroll, and so forth). They can’t harm other creatures or objects. They can flank in combat, but only with you.</p>
    <p>If your familiar is destroyed, you can restore them as a respite activity, or by spending a Recovery as a main action to bring them back into existence in an unoccupied space adjacent to you.</p>`,
